# Technical Context: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## Technology Stack
The application will be built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Build System**: Gradle
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5 with Kotlin support

## Dependencies
In accordance with the requirements, the application will have minimal dependencies:

- **Kotlin Standard Library**: For core language features and utilities
- **JUnit 5**: For testing only (not part of the runtime application)

## Development Environment
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit 11 or higher
- **IDE**: Any IDE with Kotlin support (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Constraints
- No external frameworks or libraries for the application logic
- No databases or external storage mechanisms
- No UI frameworks (the application will be a library/API)
- No network communication or remote services

## Performance Considerations
- The application is designed for in-memory operations only
- Expected to handle typical to-do list operations efficiently
- No specific optimization for large-scale data sets

## Security Considerations
- No authentication or authorization mechanisms required
- No sensitive data handling requirements
- No external communication security concerns

## Compatibility
- Compatible with any Kotlin or Java application
- No specific platform dependencies
- Can be used in any environment that supports the JVM
