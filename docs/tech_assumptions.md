# Technical Assumptions: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## Core Assumptions

1. **Task Representation**
   - Tasks will be represented as simple strings
   - No additional metadata (due dates, priorities, etc.) will be stored
   - Each task is unique based on its string content

2. **Storage Implementation**
   - A mutable list will be used for in-memory storage
   - No persistence between application runs is required
   - Memory usage will be proportional to the number and size of tasks

3. **Concurrency**
   - The application will not specifically handle concurrent modifications
   - If used in a multi-threaded environment, external synchronization would be required
   - The implementation will focus on single-threaded usage scenarios

4. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling for invalid operations will be implemented
   - Appropriate exceptions will be thrown for invalid inputs or states
   - No complex recovery mechanisms are needed

5. **Performance**
   - Standard list operations will provide adequate performance for typical use cases
   - No specialized data structures are needed for optimization
   - The application is not expected to handle extremely large task lists

## Implementation Decisions

1. **API Design**
   - The API will be simple and intuitive
   - Method names will clearly indicate their purpose
   - Return types will be consistent and predictable

2. **Task Validation**
   - Empty or blank tasks will not be allowed
   - Duplicate tasks will be prevented
   - Maximum length of tasks will not be explicitly limited

3. **Collection Management**
   - Tasks will be stored in the order they are added
   - Removing a task will not affect the order of remaining tasks
   - The list of tasks will be returned as an immutable copy to prevent external modification

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests will cover all public API methods
   - Edge cases will be thoroughly tested
   - Test-driven development will be used to guide the implementation
