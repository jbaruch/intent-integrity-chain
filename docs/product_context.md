# Product Context: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## Intent
The intent of this project is to create a minimal in-memory to-do list application in Kotlin. This application will provide basic functionality for managing tasks without relying on external storage or frameworks.

## Goals
1. Create a simple, lightweight to-do list application
2. Implement core task management functionality
3. Ensure the application is easy to use and understand
4. Follow clean code principles and best practices
5. Demonstrate Kotlin programming capabilities

## Scope
The application will be limited to in-memory storage and will not persist data between application restarts. It will focus on the core functionality of managing tasks without any additional features like due dates, priorities, or categories.

## Target Users
This application is intended for:
- Developers who need a simple to-do list implementation
- Users who need a basic task management solution
- Educational purposes to demonstrate Kotlin programming

## Success Criteria
The application will be considered successful if it:
1. Allows users to add tasks
2. Allows users to remove tasks
3. Provides a way to view the current list of tasks
4. Maintains tasks in memory during the application's runtime
5. Is implemented using only Kotlin standard library
