# Requirements: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Task Management
1.1. **Add Task**
   - The system shall allow adding a new task to the to-do list
   - Tasks shall be represented as strings
   - The system shall not allow adding empty or blank tasks
   - The system shall not allow adding duplicate tasks
   - The system shall return a success indicator when a task is added

1.2. **Remove Task**
   - The system shall allow removing an existing task from the to-do list
   - The system shall identify tasks by their exact string content
   - The system shall return a success indicator when a task is removed
   - The system shall indicate when a task to be removed does not exist

1.3. **List Tasks**
   - The system shall provide a way to retrieve all current tasks
   - The system shall return tasks in the order they were added
   - The system shall return an empty list when no tasks exist
   - The system shall return an immutable list to prevent external modification

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 2. Performance
2.1. **Response Time**
   - All operations shall complete in constant or linear time relative to the number of tasks
   - The system shall be optimized for typical to-do list sizes (dozens to hundreds of items)

### 3. Reliability
3.1. **Error Handling**
   - The system shall provide clear error messages for invalid operations
   - The system shall maintain a consistent state even after failed operations

### 4. Usability
4.1. **API Design**
   - The API shall be intuitive and easy to use
   - Method names shall clearly indicate their purpose
   - The API shall be consistent in its behavior and return types

### 5. Constraints
5.1. **Implementation Constraints**
   - The system shall be implemented in Kotlin
   - The system shall use only in-memory storage
   - The system shall not use external frameworks or libraries beyond the Kotlin standard library
   - The system shall not use databases or external storage mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A user can add a task to the to-do list
2. A user cannot add an empty or duplicate task
3. A user can remove a task from the to-do list
4. A user can view all current tasks in the to-do list
5. All operations maintain the integrity of the to-do list
6. The application uses only in-memory storage
7. The application is implemented using only Kotlin standard library
