# System Architecture: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## Overview
The in-memory to-do list application will follow a simple, modular architecture that emphasizes clean separation of concerns. Given the minimal nature of the application, we'll use a straightforward design that avoids unnecessary complexity.

## Architecture Pattern
The application will use a basic component-based architecture with:

1. **Core Domain Model**
   - Represents the fundamental entities (tasks) and their operations
   - Encapsulates the business logic for task management

2. **Service Layer**
   - Provides the main functionality for managing tasks
   - Handles adding, removing, and listing tasks
   - Maintains the in-memory storage of tasks

3. **Interface Layer**
   - Defines the public API for interacting with the to-do list
   - Provides clean, well-defined methods for client code

## Component Relationships
```
[Interface Layer] → [Service Layer] → [Domain Model]
```

## Data Flow
1. Client code interacts with the public interface
2. Interface delegates to the service layer
3. Service layer performs operations on the domain model
4. Results are returned through the service layer to the client

## Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation details are hidden behind well-defined interfaces
- **Immutability**: Where appropriate, immutable data structures will be used
- **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering; keep the design minimal and focused

## Memory Management
- All data will be stored in memory using appropriate Kotlin data structures
- No persistence layer or external storage will be used
- Memory usage will be optimized for the expected scale of a simple to-do list
