# Test Scenarios: In-Memory To-Do List Application

## 1. Task Addition Tests

### 1.1 Basic Task Addition
- **Scenario**: Add a valid task to an empty to-do list
- **Expected**: Task is successfully added and can be retrieved from the list
- **Verification**: List contains exactly one task with the correct content

### 1.2 Multiple Task Addition
- **Scenario**: Add multiple valid tasks to the to-do list
- **Expected**: All tasks are successfully added in the correct order
- **Verification**: List contains all added tasks in the order they were added

### 1.3 Empty Task Validation
- **Scenario**: Attempt to add an empty task
- **Expected**: Operation fails with appropriate error
- **Verification**: List remains unchanged and error is reported

### 1.4 Blank Task Validation
- **Scenario**: Attempt to add a blank task (whitespace only)
- **Expected**: Operation fails with appropriate error
- **Verification**: List remains unchanged and error is reported

### 1.5 Duplicate Task Validation
- **Scenario**: Attempt to add a task that already exists in the list
- **Expected**: Operation fails with appropriate error
- **Verification**: List remains unchanged and error is reported

## 2. Task Removal Tests

### 2.1 Basic Task Removal
- **Scenario**: Remove an existing task from the to-do list
- **Expected**: Task is successfully removed from the list
- **Verification**: List no longer contains the removed task

### 2.2 Non-existent Task Removal
- **Scenario**: Attempt to remove a task that doesn't exist in the list
- **Expected**: Operation fails with appropriate error
- **Verification**: List remains unchanged and error is reported

### 2.3 Multiple Task Removal
- **Scenario**: Remove multiple tasks from the to-do list
- **Expected**: All specified tasks are successfully removed
- **Verification**: List no longer contains any of the removed tasks

### 2.4 Empty List Task Removal
- **Scenario**: Attempt to remove a task from an empty list
- **Expected**: Operation fails with appropriate error
- **Verification**: Error is reported

## 3. Task Listing Tests

### 3.1 Empty List Retrieval
- **Scenario**: Retrieve tasks from an empty to-do list
- **Expected**: An empty list is returned
- **Verification**: Returned list has zero elements

### 3.2 Populated List Retrieval
- **Scenario**: Retrieve tasks from a populated to-do list
- **Expected**: All tasks are returned in the correct order
- **Verification**: Returned list contains all tasks in the order they were added

### 3.3 List Immutability
- **Scenario**: Attempt to modify the returned list of tasks
- **Expected**: Modification attempts should not affect the internal list
- **Verification**: Original list remains unchanged despite modification attempts on the returned list

## 4. Edge Case Tests

### 4.1 Boundary Testing
- **Scenario**: Add tasks with very long content
- **Expected**: Tasks are successfully added regardless of length
- **Verification**: List contains the long tasks with their content intact

### 4.2 Special Character Testing
- **Scenario**: Add tasks with special characters and symbols
- **Expected**: Tasks are successfully added with special characters preserved
- **Verification**: List contains the tasks with all special characters intact
